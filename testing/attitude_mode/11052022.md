It is sunny, clear, but rather windy.

First HMB flight with new altitude mode (just supporting in the background around stick zero).
Kyle feels good piloting it. He says he feels in control and the vehicle is responsive.
Not notable lag.

But there is a significant yaw to the left... wind, bias, control?
We flew the same vehicle with the same software this morning and did not observe any yaw drift.

again lot's of yaw... also drifts away pretty quickly

Philipp

again hard yaw to the left

Eric

still +y drift

very agressive full +r to full -r, shakey behavior, near crash.
check attitude controller performance.

flew coordinated turns with a lot of yawing.... provoked definitely imu filter, shaky, feels not very tight

has a lot of fun. got a good video of this one.
flew fast, felt in control but some quirky behavior sometimes....

Hamilton


rather smooth


### 2022_05_11__15_16_22__irl_product_r3__S2.0I.B.000023__coneja023


Harvest

found that yaw drift is due to drag on front antenna from wind.
he turned the vehicle 180 degree and it yawed in the other direction.

Kyle

pretty solid, now yaw





### 2022_05_11__15_27_43__irl_product_e1__E1.0J.A.00CN57__SkydioX2-cn57


Eric

it is smoother when you go high r/p, but goes beyond setpoint and starts to wobble when you go fast.


### 2022_05_11__15_37_13__irl_product_e1__E1.0J.A.00CN57__SkydioX2-cn57


Hamilton

again same problem

very smooth flight, some long stretches against and with the wind.
then throttle punches and min throttle rapid descents in the end, looks very smooth!
